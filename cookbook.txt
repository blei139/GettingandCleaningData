Code Book:
The original dataset is from the original data source (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  This code book describes the data, features, and labels, describing the different activities such as walking, running, and sitting.  The goal is to clean the dataset into a tidy dataset.
The steps to clean the data is described in the readme file.
Features:
There are 561 feature names.
Labels:
There are  6 output labels which are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING.

Steps to clean the untidy data:

1)   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each   
          measurement.
3)  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5)   Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
         activity and each subject.
